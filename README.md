# Classification_of_students_performance

In this project i have clafsified student into their respective catagories that they belongs according to their performance and behaviour. This is the multi-class classification project where we have 3 classes namely High, Medium, Low.
With help of this project we can categories the students into their categories and can predict their early raise and fall of the students performance also it helps them in choosing their area of interest.

The things that I have added here are after catagorising them I give the analysis of them that how they are performing with respect to their peers and will give the intuitive feedback that on which area they should work so that their performance increase.
